The OCF RA shared code directory

If an RA is too big to be comfortably maintained, split it into
several source files. Obviosuly, if two or more RAs share some
code, move that code out to a file which can be shared.

These files will be installed in $OCF_ROOT/lib/heartbeat with
permissions 644.

Naming practice

Use names such as <RA>.sh or <RA>-check.sh or anything-else.sh
where "anything-else" should be related to both the RA and the
code it contains. By adding extension (.sh) it is going to be
easier to notice that these files are not complete resource
agents.

For instance, oracle and oralsnr RA can both use code in
ora-common.sh.

Of course, if the RA is implemented in another programming
language, use the appropriate extension.
